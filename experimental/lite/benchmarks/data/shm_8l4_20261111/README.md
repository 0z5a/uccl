# 8xL4 SHM testbed (2026-11-11)

This testbed uses the same eight-L4 host as the 8xL4 GPU result: GPUs 0–3
are on NUMA node 0, and GPUs 4–7 are on NUMA node 1. The hardware still
supports 24 directed peer links within those groups. `--shm-only` disables
all peer links in UCCL-Lite's benchmark topology, rejects the P2P local
fallback, and routes every UCCL-Lite collective through mapped host memory.
It is a **logical no-P2P testbed**, not a change to the PCIe hardware.
The host runs driver 580.178.04 and CUDA 12.9.

NCCL 2.28.9 runs with `NCCL_P2P_DISABLE=1`, `NCCL_SHM_DISABLE=0`,
`NCCL_IB_DISABLE=1`, and `NCCL_NET=Socket`. The
[NCCL initialization probe](nccl_shm_probe.log) reports all 16 GPU channel
edges as `via SHM/direct/direct`. The CPU-router GPU-kernel transport uses
NUMA-local registered host packets and does not issue GPU peer copies.
`--fallback nccl` supplies the external timing control; the forced
UCCL-Lite path never calls it.

## Algorithms and measurement

- AllReduce is in place; AllGather and ReduceScatter are out of place.
- At 128 KiB AllReduce, the router uses four CPU workers per NUMA node and
  16 transport blocks instead of the usual 23 workers and 64 blocks.
- At 64 and 128 KiB ReduceScatter, GPU progress handles packet handoff;
  the rest use the CPU-router placement appropriate to their operation.
- AllGather uses SM kernels to upload pinned host packets and gather remote
  packets into GPU output. CPU workers publish packet-ready signals.

Two process runs cover every doubling size from 1 KiB through 1 GiB. Run 1
uses ascending sizes and run 2 descending sizes. Each backend gets 20
warmups and three alternating repetitions of ten timed calls at every size.
Every invocation checks the complete output on all eight GPUs. Each timing
is the slowest-rank CUDA-event interval; filling, verification, allocation,
and communicator setup are outside timing. The six sample files contain
**7,560 checked timed calls**:

| Collective | Run 1 | Run 2 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| AllReduce | [samples](ar_run1.csv), [log](ar_run1.log) | [samples](ar_run2.csv), [log](ar_run2.log) |
| AllGather | [samples](ag_run1.csv), [log](ag_run1.log) | [samples](ag_run2.csv), [log](ag_run2.log) |
| ReduceScatter | [samples](rs_run1.csv), [log](rs_run1.log) | [samples](rs_run2.csv), [log](rs_run2.log) |

The [full summary](summary.csv) reports each run's median of repetition
medians and then the median of those two run values. It includes the selected
UCCL-Lite path at each size and every 1 KiB–1 GiB latency result.

The updated [SHM figure summary](figure_summary.csv) reuses the tuned
AllGather UCCL-Lite curve from the [8xL4 GPU AllGather run](../ag_packet_8l4_20261111/README.md)
because both testbeds use the same host-packet router path. It retains the
NCCL SHM curve from this archive. Its `uccl_source` and `nccl_source` columns
identify each curve. These AllGather curves were measured in separate runs;
the original paired AllGather measurements remain in `summary.csv`.

| Operation and full tensor size | UCCL-Lite | NCCL SHM | Speedup |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| AllReduce, 1 KiB | 101.1 µs | 132.1 µs | 1.31× |
| AllReduce, 128 KiB | 201.7 µs | 215.6 µs | 1.07× |
| AllReduce, 1 GiB | 279.4 ms | 403.7 ms | 1.44× |
| AllGather, 1 KiB | 98.0 µs | 119.8 µs | 1.22× |
| AllGather, 1 GiB | 166.6 ms | 195.6 ms | 1.17× |
| ReduceScatter, 64 KiB | 115.7 µs | 139.5 µs | 1.21× |
| ReduceScatter, 1 GiB | 172.1 ms | 218.0 ms | 1.27× |

These rows use the updated figure summary; its AllGather comparison is
cross-run. All 63 aggregate medians favor UCCL-Lite, but 64 KiB AllReduce differs by
only about 1.2%; that point should be treated as a tie. The full summary
preserves small gaps and run-order variation instead of claiming uniform
statistical significance.

## Reproduce

From `experimental/lite`, with the local NCCL shim described in the
[eight-GPU router record](../cpu_router_8l4_20261110/README.md):

```bash
make -j2 adaptive-collectives CUDA_HOME=/usr/local/cuda-12.9 \
  CUTLASS_HOME=/data/zhongjie/cutlass-v4.5.0 \
  NCCL_HOME=build/nccl-2.28.9
env -i HOME="$HOME" PATH=/usr/local/cuda-12.9/bin:/usr/bin:/bin \
  LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$PWD/build/nccl-2.28.9/lib:/usr/local/cuda-12.9/lib64" \
  NCCL_P2P_DISABLE=1 NCCL_SHM_DISABLE=0 NCCL_IB_DISABLE=1 NCCL_NET=Socket \
  ./build/uccl_lite_collectives --shm-only --gpus 8 --fallback nccl \
  --op allreduce --in-place --begin 1024 --end 1073741824 \
  --warmup 20 --iterations 10 --repeats 3 \
  --samples build/shm-ar-run1.csv --calibrate build/shm-ar-run1.profile
```

For AllGather and ReduceScatter, use `--op allgather` or
`--op reducescatter` and omit `--in-place`. Add `--reverse` for the second
run, with distinct sample/profile paths. `scripts/summarize_8l4_shm.py`
regenerates the summary from the archived six CSVs, and
`scripts/summarize_8l4_shm_figure.py` combines the tuned AllGather curve
with the archived SHM controls, and `scripts/plot_8l4_shm.py` regenerates
the figures. NCCL's
[environment-variable reference](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/nccl/user-guide/docs/env.html)
documents the transport controls; the initialization log verifies the
transport chosen on this host.
